The **Bristol Fairchild Bolingbroke** is a [maritime patrol aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maritime_patrol_aircraft) and trainer used by the [Royal Canadian Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Canadian_Air_Force) during the [Second World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War). Built by [Fairchild-Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairchild_Aircraft_Ltd._(Canada)), it was a license-built version of the [Bristol Blenheim Mk IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Blenheim) bomber.

The **Bristol Blenheim** is a British [light bomber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_bomber) aircraft designed and built by the [Bristol Aeroplane Company](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_Aeroplane_Company) (Bristol) which was used extensively in the first two years and in some cases throughout the [Second World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_World_War). The aircraft was developed as *Type 142*, a civil airliner, in response to a challenge from [Lord Rothermere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harold_Harmsworth,_1st_Viscount_Rothermere) to produce the fastest commercial aircraft in Europe. The *Type 142* first flew in April 1935, and the [Air Ministry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Ministry), impressed by its performance, ordered a modified design as the *Type 142M* for the [Royal Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force) (RAF) as a bomber. Deliveries of the newly named Blenheim to RAF squadrons commenced on 10 March 1937.

A development of the Type 142M was the Type 149 which Bristol  named the Bolingbroke, retrospectively changed by the Air Ministry to  Blenheim Mk IV and the Type 142M to the Blenheim Mk I. Fairchild Canada  built the Type 149 under licence as the Bolingbroke. Blenheims Mk I and  the Mk IV were adapted as fighters by the addition of a gun pack of four Browning .303 machine guns in the bomb bay. The Mk IV was used as a  long range fighter and as a maritime patrol aircraft; both aircraft were also used as bomber/gunnery trainers.

The Blenheim was one of the first British aircraft with an all-metal [stressed-skin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monocoque#Aircraft) construction, retractable [landing gear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landing_gear), [flaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flap_(aircraft)), a powered [gun turret](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gun_turret) and [variable-pitch propellers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable-pitch_propeller_(aeronautics)). The Mk I was faster than most fighters in the late 1930s but the  advance in development of monoplane fighters made all bombers more  vulnerable particularly if flown in daylight, though it proved  successful as a night fighter. The Blenheim was effective as a bomber  but many were shot down. Both Blenheim types were used by overseas  operators, being licence built in Yugoslavia and Finland.<sup>1</sub>
