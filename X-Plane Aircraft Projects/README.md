# X-Plane Aircraft

Re-creation for X-Plane 11, of various aircraft of historic interest, particularly to the Commonwealth Air Training Plan as well as miscellaneous others

## The Commonwealth Air Training Plan (BCATP) 1939-1945

With the approach of WW2 the need for airmen, pilots gunners etc., was dire and prompted the establishment of a network of training bases throughout the commonwealth (including Australia, Canada and New Zealand) This resulted in a massive addition of aircraft facilities in the host countries which persist, for the most part, in some form to today. Though the runways continue to be usable and often regularly used, unfortunately many facilities have fallen in disrepair.

There is a collection of BCATP scenery (Flight Ontario, Al Gay, Grant Wilson) for older flight simulators available (FSX and FS2004 Prepar3d etc.) these have been slow to be promoted to X-Plane (and FS 2021).  This project is to create aircraft models as scenery and perhaps later flyanle aircraft from the WW2 era and beyond. These aircraft will include a preponderance of British Wartime aircraft for obvious reasons

## Development

I was introduced to modern flight simulation with X-Plane and found scenery development quite approachable first modeling with AC3D and more recently open source Blender. Layout/overlay development has in my hands been with World Editor (WED) and a myriad of open object libraries. There are no open source static aircraft for war-era scenery of airfields/aerodromes at this writing so I must create my owns.

Blender is the primary modeling tool used and Krita is used to creat the necessary textures as thing stand right now. I will be exploring more photorealistic textures as I learn the tools better.



## Aircraft Modeling

### Static Aircraft

- Avro Anson Mk I
- Bristol Bolingbroke
- Fairey Battle
- Westland Lysander
- Airspeed Oxford (under development)


### X-plane Flyable Models

- Bristol Blenheim Mk IV Model 146 (Fairchild Canada Bolingbroke) [beta version]()
