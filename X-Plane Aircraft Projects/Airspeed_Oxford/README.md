## Airspeed Oxford

The **Airspeed AS.10 Oxford** was a twin-engine [monoplane](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoplane) aircraft developed and manufactured by [Airspeed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspeed_Ltd). It saw widespread use for training [British Commonwealth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonwealth_of_Nations) aircrews in navigation, radio-operating, bombing and gunnery roles throughout the [Second World War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_II).

The Oxford was developed by Airspeed during the 1930s in response to a requirement for a capable trainer aircraft that conformed with [Specification T.23/36](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Air_Ministry_specifications#1930.E2.80.931939), which had been issued by the British [Air Ministry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_Ministry). Its basic design is derived from the company's earlier [AS.6 Envoy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airspeed_Envoy), a commercial passenger aircraft. Performing its [maiden flight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maiden_flight) on 19 June 1937, it was quickly put into production as part of a rapid expansion of the [Royal Air Force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Air_Force) (RAF)
