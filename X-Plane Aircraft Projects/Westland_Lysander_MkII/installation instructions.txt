### Aircraft Installation ###

The installation of the aircraft involves simply copying all the 
extracted files from the distribution zip into a director with 
the aircraft name created in the X-Plane aircraft directory.

Support may be obtained via the forums of X-plane.org or from 
the respective github repository directory tree at: 

https://github.com/medmatix/Aircraft3D_Modeling/tree/main/X-Plane%20Aircraft%20Projects

Feedback may be left as comments in the X-plane.org download 
location or as an issue at yhe github repository above.

Lastly I can be messaged for datayork at xplane.org.
