FS2004 / FSX Single Bristol Mercury IX Radial engine sound set created by Gary Jones.


Perfect for Gloster Gladiators and Westland Lysanders.

================


These sounds are released as FREEWARE and must be kept so.


================

A few default MSFS sounds were also used to make this set possible.

================

Enjoy!
