# X-Plane Aircraft

In response to a request on xplane.org, (https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/profile/889525-cthulhuborn/) from 2020, and with my inclinations towards RCAF and RAF aircraft, I have decided to open a project on the de Havilland DHC-5 Buffalo.

## Aircraft in Development

The **de Havilland Canada DHC-5 Buffalo** is a short takeoff and landing ([STOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STOL)) utility transport [turboprop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turboprop) aircraft developed from the earlier piston-powered [DHC-4 Caribou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Canada_DHC-4_Caribou). The aircraft has extraordinary STOL performance and is able to take off in distances much shorter than even most [light aircraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_aircraft) can manage. [^1]

**Design History**

The Buffalo arose from a 1962 [United States Army](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Army) requirement for a STOL transport capable of carrying the same payload as the [CH-47A Chinook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boeing_Vertol_CH-47_Chinook) helicopter.[[1\] ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Canada_DHC-5_Buffalo#cite_note-AI_Aug76_p59-1)[De Havilland Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Canada) based its design to meet the requirement on an enlarged version of its [DHC-4 Caribou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Havilland_Canada_DHC-4_Caribou), already in large-scale service with the United States Army, to be powered by [General Electric T64 ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Electric_T64)[turboprops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turboprop) rather than the [Pratt & Whitney R-2000 ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pratt_%26_Whitney_R-2000)[piston engines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piston_engine) of the Caribou. (It had already flown a T64-powered Caribou on 22 September 1961)

The Canadian Forces (RCAF) designation is CC-115 and the US Army designation is CV-7 A and others.
