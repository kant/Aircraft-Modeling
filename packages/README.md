# Aircraft Packages and Downloadable Objects

Re-creation for X-Plane 11, of various aircraft of historic interest, particularly to the Commonwealth Air Training Plan as well as miscellaneous others


## Development

I was introduced to modern flight simulation with X-Plane and found scenery development quite approachable first modeling with AC3D and more recently open source Blender. Layout/overlay development has in my hands been with World Editor (WED) and a myriad of open object libraries. There are no open source static aircraft for war-era scenery of airfields/aerodromes at this writing so I must create my owns.

Blender is the primary modeling tool used and Krita is used to creat the necessary textures as thing stand right now. I will be exploring more photorealistic textures as I learn the tools better.

## BCATP Picton

As this scenery is my first foray into WW2 airfields that the aircraft based there to train the Commonwealth Airmen are the first aircraft to be found here. Picton was a training base for the 31st Bombing and Gunnery school (B&GS). The aircraft there at the time were the Fairchild Bolingbroke (the Fairchild Canada contract built Bristol Bleneim Mk IV), the Avro Anson, the Westland Lysander, and the Fairey Battle.

## Using Aircraft Models

It sfould go without saying, that static aircraft models (obj8 format files) must be incorporated to your own scenery to see these in X-Plane. Scenery such as the BCATP-Picton-Aerodrome include 4 of the British WW2 training aircraft as noted there.

To Use scenery files simply unzip the compressed package into your Custom Scenery folder in X-Plane. An appropriate directory of that name should appear.

To fly aircraft in X-Plane, the zipped package is unzipped into the Aircraft directory or desired subdriectory (like "extra aircraft"). A new directory with the Aircraft designated name should appear in thre selected target directory.

Recall, for scenery, the order in the scenery_packs.ini file matters. If as recommended, the Ortho4XP overlay for Prince Edward County, Ontario, Canada is used, it must be below the BCATP-$$$$$$$ file entry.
