## About Flightgear(R) ##

**FlightGear** is an open-source flight simulator.  It  supports a variety of popular platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.) and  is developed by skilled volunteers from around the world.  Source code  for the entire project is available and licensed under the [GNU General Public License](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html).

The goal of the **FlightGear** project is to create a  sophisticated and open flight simulator framework for use in research or academic environments, pilot training, as an industry engineering tool, for DIY-ers to pursue their favorite interesting flight simulation  idea, and last but certainly not least as a fun, realistic, and  challenging desktop flight simulator. We are developing a sophisticated, open simulation framework that can be expanded and improved upon by  anyone interested in contributing.

## General Development Discussion: ##

I first started simulator object development with X-Plane 11, a lovely product but not open source which I always try to support. Also I found some of the community a little hard to deal with - probably due to the underling personal proprietary interests of contributors in a non-open source model. What ever the reason I have decided to refocus my efforts in OSS with Flightgear. 

Thought not as friendly or rife with development tools, I think it is as robust as any flight simulator developer could wish. More tools would help and my ultimately be something I can focus on. 

## Aircraft: ##

Code and resources for these projects are stored in this Aircraft-Modeling repository here. See above.

## Airports and Scenery: ##

The repository for these projects are grouped in my ["Worldscape and Scenery" Repository].
